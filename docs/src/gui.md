# Desktop GUI

Vykar includes a desktop GUI for managing repositories, running backups, and browsing/restoring snapshots. It is built with [Slint](https://slint.dev/) and [tray-icon](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tray-icon).

## Installing

### macOS

A signed app bundle (`Vykar Backup.app`) is included in the release archive. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/borgbase/vykar/releases), extract it, and drag the app to your Applications folder.

### Linux

Download the AppImage from the [releases page](https://github.com/borgbase/vykar/releases). It bundles most dependencies and runs on x86_64 Linux distributions with glibc 2.39+ (Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch, etc.):

```bash
chmod +x vykar-gui-*-x86_64.AppImage
./vykar-gui-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

AppImages require FUSE 2 to run. If you get a FUSE-related error, either install it or use the extract-and-run fallback:

```bash
# Install FUSE 2 (Ubuntu 24.04+)
sudo apt install libfuse2t64

# Or run without FUSE
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 ./vykar-gui-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Alternatively, the Intel glibc release archive includes a bare `vykar-gui` binary. It needs GTK 3 and an AppIndicator library at runtime, which most desktop distributions already ship:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0 libayatana-appindicator3-1
```

To build from source, install the development headers:

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libxkbcommon-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev
cargo build --release -p vykar-gui
```

The binary is at `target/release/vykar-gui`.

### Windows

The GUI is included in the Windows release archive. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/borgbase/vykar/releases) and extract `vykar-gui.exe`.
