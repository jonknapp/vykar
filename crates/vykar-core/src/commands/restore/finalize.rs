/// Phase 5b: apply file metadata (mode, mtime, xattrs) to a batch of files
/// while they still live inside `temp_root`.  Doing this before the final
/// rename closes a path-based reopen window — the inode keeps its metadata
/// after `move_temp_to_dest` because `rename(2)` only changes directory
/// entries, not inodes.  fd-based fchmod/futimens avoid a redundant path
/// lookup; on fd open failure the path-based call is used as a fallback.

/// Serial: each file costs a handful of cheap metadata syscalls, so there is
/// nothing to overlap. Restored files are *not* fsync'd — a restored tree is a
/// derived artifact reproducible by re-running the restore, so the durability
/// budget stays with the repository (matching restic and borg, which likewise
/// never sync extracted files).
///
/// What that costs, stated plainly: [`move_temp_to_dest`] still fsyncs
/// `dest_root`, but a directory fsync makes the moved *names* durable — never
/// the file contents or inode metadata behind them. A power loss shortly after
/// a restore can therefore leave a structurally *complete* tree whose files are
/// zero-length, truncated, or stale. Presence is not evidence of integrity: a
/// destination whose restore was interrupted by power loss must be discarded
/// and the restore re-run (`dest` is non-empty at that point, so
/// `validate_and_prepare_dest` requires clearing it first anyway). A SIGKILL is
/// the weaker case — the writes are already in the page cache, so only the
/// process dies, not the data.
